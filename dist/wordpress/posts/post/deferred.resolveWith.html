<p>Normally, only the creator of a Deferred should call this method; you can prevent other code from changing the Deferred's state by returning a restricted Promise object through <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/"><code>deferred.promise()</code></a>.</p>
<p>When the Deferred is resolved, any doneCallbacks added by <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.done/"><code>deferred.done</code></a> are called. Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Each callback is passed the <code>args</code> from the <code>.resolve()</code>. Any doneCallbacks added after the Deferred enters the resolved state are executed immediately when they are added, using the arguments that were passed to the <code>.resolve()</code> call. For more information, see the documentation for <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a>.</p>
