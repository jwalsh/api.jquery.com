<p>All three arguments (including progressCallbacks, as of jQuery 1.7) can be either a single function or an array of functions. The arguments can also be <code>null</code> if no callback of that type is desired. Alternatively, use <code>.done()</code>, <code>.fail()</code> or <code>.progress()</code> to set only one type of callback. </p>
<p>When the Deferred is resolved, the doneCallbacks are called. If the Deferred is instead rejected, the failCallbacks are called. As of jQuery 1.7, the <code>deferred.notify()</code> or <code>deferred.notifyWith()</code> methods can be called to invoke the progressCallbacks as many times as desired before the Deferred is resolved or rejected.</p>
<p>Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Since <code>deferred.then</code> returns the deferred object, other methods of the deferred object can be chained to this one, including additional <code>.then()</code> methods. For more information, see the documentation for <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a>.</p>
